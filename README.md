Hi, welcome to my Github page! My name is Yilin(Harry) Lu, and Iâ€™m pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree(with honors) at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My majors are Computer Science, Mathematics, and Quantitative Economics. I also minored in Statistical Science and Astro-Informatics(Data Science in Astrophysics). Before college, I studied Mathematics at San Diego State University through the Dual Enrollment Option and graduated from Torrey Pines High School.

My current research interests are human-computer interactions and information science. I also have a deep passion for visualization, economics, and astronomy. Currently, Iâ€™m working with Prof. Qianwen Wang on a visualization project. I also work as a Science Intern at TURBO Telescope Group at the Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics, where my PIs are Prof. Patrick Kelly and Dr. Mandeep S Gill.

In my free time, I enjoy visual arts, reading, cooking, origami, and game design(especially strategic games). If we have any common research interests, please get in touch with me using the methods below.
